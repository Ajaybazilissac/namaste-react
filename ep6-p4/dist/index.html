<!--
order of files matter a lot

as soon as the browser load this page it will print
Ajay is here in the browser. But as soon as it goes to the scripts
, load react and the  load reactDOM in to our app
then it will load the app.js to the app, then  start
executing the code on app.js line by line. when it react the line having
root.render(), it will render the parent inside the root. it will replace 
what ever inside the root with what ever we are passing through react.
